Electic Avenue is a simple clicker game that revolves around upgrading different forms of energy sources. In this clicker game, players start by clicking on a basic energy source to generate energy. As they collect more energy, they can use it to upgrade their energy source and make it more efficient. With each upgrade, players can generate energy faster, allowing them to accumulate more energy and purchase even more upgrades. The game continues in this cycle, with players continuously upgrading their energy source and collecting more energy until they reach the maximum upgrade level. The objective of the game is to reach the highest possible upgrade level and collect the most amount of energy possible.

## How to play:
Playing this game is very simple, there are energy sources on the map that you collect energy from, once you collect enough energy you can buy more resources from the store, as well as upgrade them in the upgrade tab.

The goal of the game is to reduce pollution and get the pollution meter in the top right into the green.
